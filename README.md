# Flappy Bird AI with NEAT NeuroEvolution

This project implements an AI to play the popular game **Flappy Bird** using the **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** algorithm. The AI evolves over generations to optimize the bird's performance, aiming to achieve the highest fitness by navigating through pipes without collisions.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the power of **NeuroEvolution** by applying it to a simple game. The NEAT algorithm evolves both the architecture and weights of a neural network, allowing the bird to learn how to navigate the game environment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
You will need Python 3.x installed on your machine along with the following libraries:
- `neat-python`: Library for implementing NEAT algorithms
- `pygame`: Library to handle the game rendering and logic

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
